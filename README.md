# SashaTicketAPIAgent
This software implements some methods of the Zammad API in order to perform advanced custom workflows that Zammad does not support by default.

It's called the SashaTicketAPIAgent cause that's the name of the CEO and the system :)

Docs coming soon. Perhaps I will actually implement the API in a cuter way.

License coming soon too. This will be open source, but it hardly even works!
